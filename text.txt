00:54
we create a workspace is to associate it
00:56
with some set of terraform configuration
00:59
so we have our config now that
01:03
configuration can live in inversion
01:05
control so we have built in integrations
01:08
with things like github gitlab bitbucket
01:10
right out-of-the-box but you can also
01:13
upload configuration manually using the
01:15
api's or the CLI for example the next
01:19
thing that we need to do after we have
01:20
our configuration is to provide some
01:23
sort of variables for those
01:24
configuration files right so we have our
01:27
variables so we have this these two
01:31
things right here so now that we have
01:33
our configuration and our variables we
01:35
want to take them and actually do
01:36
something with it right we want to apply
01:38
these changes to our environment so if
01:40
you're familiar with how Tara from open
01:42
source works you know we split things up
01:44
into a plan and apply phase right so we
01:46
have our plan apply and in our plan we
01:51
see the steps that terraform is actually
01:53
going to take in our environment before
01:55
making any changes so all the resources
01:57
that it's going to create modify or
01:59
delete and then in the apply is where we
02:01
actually make the changes to our
02:03
environment and in terraform Enterprise
02:05
within the concept of a workspace we
02:07
wrap this whole thing up in what's
02:09
called a run and because we've separated
02:13
these two phase
02:14
right we have our plan and our ply we
02:17
can now serialize through these and add
02:19
additional steps so in terraform
02:21
enterprise we also add a phase for
02:24
sentinel if you're not familiar with
02:29
what sentinel is it's hoshi corpse
02:31
policy s code framework essentially it
02:33
lets us create guardrails or sand boxes
02:37
around different things that you can or
02:39
cannot do with terraform and also
02:41
because we have this separation of the
02:42
distinct phases here we're also able to
02:44
add additional steps as we add more
02:46
functionality to terraform Enterprise so
02:50
we take these steps and because we've
02:52
wrapped this in this logical construct
02:53
of a run we're also able to queue up
02:55
additional runs so that we're not
02:57
clobbering other people and they're you
03:00
know their resources and then finally
03:02
after a run completes and terraform goes
03:05
through the SEP steps of planning and
03:08
doing its policy checks and actually
03:09
applying the changes to the environment
03:11
we have the output of a state file and
03:16
it's important here to really outline
03:19
the distinction that for every workspace
03:22
you have a very deliberate one-to-one
03:24
mapping between the configuration and
03:26
the state file now the last thing that
03:30
we could do in the workspace is
03:31
basically take this entire thing and we
03:33
wrap it in a set of permissions
